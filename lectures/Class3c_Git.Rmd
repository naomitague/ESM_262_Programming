# <span style="color:orange"> Git and what to do with it </span>

<span style="color:green">Local Git</span>

* keep track of changes to your code on your computer
* when necessary, go back to early versions

<span style="color:green">GitHub</span>

* access your code from different places
* collaborate with others
  * others who will use your code
  * coding together
 

![git](../img/gitandgithub.jpg)


# <span style="color:orange"> Completed Assignment </span>

1. Create a new function (it can do whatever you think might be interesting)
  * make sure you document it well
2. Add it to your repo, in the same *R* directory where you included the function from last class
3. Commit your changes
4. Push your changes to your Github Repo
5. Submit the link to your Github Repo, for Assignment 2 on Canvas, Due Feb 27



# <span style="color:orange"> Collaborations </span>

Steps to collaborate with someone on a repository

There are several ways - we will cover the most common

1. Personal Repositories add collaborators

    * Settings -> Manage Access -> Invite a collaborator
    * Write access for collaborators that can push changes
    * They will get an email and need to accept
  
2. Clone your partner's repository on your computer

3. Make a change and push it back to the repository

# <span style="color:orange"> How conflicts occur </span>

![git](../img/gitconflict.jpg)
# Lets Try it

With your partner

1. Open your own repository
2. Before you *pull* your partners changes, make a change to the same file
3. Now try to *pull*


# <span style="color:orange"> Resolving conflicts </span>


Git will tell you when there is a conflict AND edit the file to show you the conflict

it used 
<<<<<< HEAD
changes you are trying to make
======
what was there before
>>>>>>
  
What to do!

1. Edit the file to resolve the conflict including removing the <<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>)
2. Save the file
3. Add the file
4. Commit the file
5. Push to Github


# <span style="color:orange"> For next class: Re-submit Assignment </span>

Based on any feedback or suggested changes from your partner, update your repository
for Assignment 3

We will grade based on the last commit by tomorrow morning

# <span style="color:orange"> A bit more </span>

Sometime you want to play with code on your own without impacting the *main*
repository

Useful for testing, adding features to more complex code, etc.

You can *fork* a repository (make a copy) and then *clone* it to your computer

You can then *merge* changes back to the original repository

Details on how to do this and other git commands a

[Happy Git](https://happygitwithr.com/) 



* Review looping.Rmd - its a long one

Now that you know *Git* Two ways to get the Rmarkdown File

You can either clone the following repository or just go to the repo on github and download the file

[Example/Review Repo](https://github.com/naomitague/ESM_262_Examples.git")

"git clone https://github.com/naomitague/ESM_262_Examples.git"


**IF Your are Cloning**

- make sure this is in a completely R project in a separate directory from your assignments directory (git doesn't like two different repos in the same place!)
 
 - find and review *Rmarkdown/starting_functions.Rmd* BEFORE next class - play with it; come ready to ask questions in class


If you are cloning in a **new project** - you can use
```{r}
library(devtools)
 install_github("naomitague/ESM_262_Examples")
```
