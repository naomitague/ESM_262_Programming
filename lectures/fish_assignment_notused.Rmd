# Assignment 

Write a function that takes a vector of fish names and always returns three items

* the most common fish, 
* the rarest fish
* the total number of fish

Create an Rmarkdown to demonstrate the use of your function with fish.txt - which
is under Data on ESM_262_Examples

[Data on ESM_262_Examples]{https://github.com/naomitague/ESM_262_Examples/blob/main/Data/fish.txt}

Turn in on Gauchospace what your function returns when you run with fish.txt!

*Challenge*: What if we had multiple catches - how would you run your summary function for all of those catches - see below for an example to generate multiple catches
You don't have to run this one in but we will go over in class

```{r  challenge}
# generate some data if we had 10 different fishing days
# some examples of using the purr family of functions

possible.fish = c("salmon","steelhead","shark","tuna","cod")

# lets generate random sample of the number of fish caught on each day
ndays=10
catches = round(runif(min=3, max=400, n=ndays))

# now for each fishing day (and its number of fish caught) - use sample to genreate the fish
catches_res = list(catches) %>% pmap(sample, x=possible.fish, replace=TRUE)
# look at the sample catches
catches_res[[1]]
catches_res[[10]]

# ok so how do we get the summary (rarest fish, number of fish for all catches in catch_res)?

```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
