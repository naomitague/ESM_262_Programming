## Course description

<div style="font-size: 22px;">

ESM 262 is an introduction to computing for environmental applications. The course provides practical training in software design best practices. 

Topics include programming language concepts; modular program design; data structures and flow control, version control, testing, documentation and reproducibility. 

The course features **R** for programming, **Git** for version control, **Markdown** for workflow, and **GitHub** for collaboration and publishing, but many concepts would be applicable in other software design tools. 

Class will include a mix of lectures and hands-on examples, using students' own computers. There will be weekly assignments designed to help learn skills through practice.

## Learning objectives

-   3 *BIG* concepts in programming are *modularity*, *data structure*, *looping*. This course is designed to help student gains skills related to all three of these concepts.

-   Students will also learn and practice some coding/programming best practices (that will doing data science easier)

    -   documentation
    -   testing
    -   partner coding/collaboration

-   Student will learn *R* skills that are helpful for a wide variety of data science applications
