## Welcome ESM 262



### How class will work:

Before each class, I will give you an Rmarkdown document to review, 
In class I will provide some lecture materials, and we will briefly go through the Rmarkdown document, I'll answer questions and add some additional comments, then we will do an in class exercise
Assignments will usually evolve from this exercise.

All materials will be available on this website


## Course description

ESM 262 is an introduction to computing for environmental applications. The course provides practical training in software design best practices. Topics include  programming language concepts; modular program design; data structures and flow control, version control, testing, documentation and reproducibility. The course features **R** for programming, **Git** for version control, **Markdown** for workflow, and **GitHub** for collaboration and publishing, but many concepts would be applicable in other software design tools.
Class will include a mix of lectures and hands-on examples, using students' own computers.

-   **Lectures:** MW 9:30 AM - 10:45 AM (Bren Hall 1510)

## Teaching team

**Instructor:** Naomi Tague (www.tagueteamlab.org)

-   **Office hours:** email me
-   **email**  (tague@ucsb.edu)
-   **git user id** naomitague

**Teaching assistant:** Ojas S


-   **Office hours:**  Tuesday / Thursday 3pm-4pm
-   **email** (ojassarup@ucsb.edu )
-   **git user id** osarup



## Learning objectives

- 3 *BIG* concepts in programming are *modularity*, *data structure*, *looping* - we will learns skills related to all three of these

- learn and practice some coding/programming best practices (that will make your data science life easier - whatever you do!)
  - documentation
  - testing

- learn some new Rskills that are helpful for a wide variety of data science applications

- practice partner coding

## Course requirements

### Computing

-   Make sure you have installed git, R, R-studio

-   Please bring your laptop to class

-   Make sure you have a Github account

## Course materials and how we will work

All lecture materials will be available on this course website as well as assignments. (But you will submit assignments on Gauchospace)

Prior to most classes,  I will ask you to study an Rmarkdown document (and often an example R-functions) before class
Then at the beginning of class, I will **briefly** go over the document and we will discuss any questions. Occasionally I spend 10-15 minutes lecturing. We will spend most of the class working on practical applications of what was in the document.  This way we use the class time as a lab - where you can get guidance.  

**this mean its essential for you to do the review before class **

Why structure it this way?
You learn to code by doing - not so much by watching others do!


## Assignments

There will be 6 short assignment (more or less one for each class). You will usually have time to work on the assignment in class and most will be in groups. We'll evaluate your assignments by pulling the GitHub repository that they live in.

To set this up:

1. Create a single private git hub repo to hold all of your assignments (and nothing else!).
2. Invite Ojas ('osarup`) and Naomi (`naomitague`) to collaborate on this repo.

Then, for each assignment:

1. Put your solution, and all the files needed to run it, in its own folder within the repo.
2. Submit the URL of the folder on Gauchospace
